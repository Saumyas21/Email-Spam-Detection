# Email-Spam-Detection
It is used to identify the spam mails and messages.This project proposed various spam detection methods to detect and filter spam and spammers. There are a plenty of antispam tools and techniques, but the spam rate is still very high. The most dangerous spams are malicious emails containing links to malicious websites that can harm the victimâ€™s data. Spam emails can also slow down the server response by filling up the memory or capacity of servers.Among all the techniques developed for detecting and preventing spam, filtering email is one of the most essential and prominent approaches.
Spam detection and filtration gained the attention of a sizeable research community. The reason for a lot of research in this area is its costly and massive effect in many situations like consumer behavior and fake reviews. The survey covers various machine learning techniques and models that the various researchers have proposed to detect and filter spam in emails and IoT platforms. The study categorized them as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, etc. The study compares these approaches and provides a summary of learned lessons from each category. This study concludes that most of the proposed email and IoT spam detection methods are based on supervised machine learning techniques.
